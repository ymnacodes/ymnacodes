- I'm yomna, 19.
- I got into a compsci institute to get out of my comfort zone.
- I’m currently learning C because it's required. However!! I do want to learn js whenever I can. 
- I want to prove that someone who never coded before can indeed become a good developer (to myself mostly).
- i never tracked any progress in my life so here's for a new start.
- i hope you become a part of it.
- yomnajaafar03@gmail.com is where u can reach me. hmu now, i might become the next big thing later.
